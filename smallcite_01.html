        <p> Hayley Williams was born on December 27, 1988 in Meridian, Mississippi, USA as Hayley Nichole Williams. She later moved to Franklin, Tennessee, USA. At the age of 15, she joined / created the band Paramore, and has toured with them ever since. The band consisted of Jeremey Davis, Zac Farro, and Josh Farro. In 2005 they released their first album, "All We Know is Falling," a punk-rock album that debuted their career. In 2007 they released RIOT!, an international hit for its time. They shifted from a punk-rock to an alternative-rock and released Brand New Eyes. This featured their number one song of all time "The Only Exception." This sparked off Hayley William's carrer even more, as artists such as B.o.B. and Zedd wanted her unique and versatile voice in their songs.</p>

        <p> This caused a dispute in the band, causing the Farro brothers to leave. Hayley did a solo feature in the songs "Airplanes" and "Stay the Night" before released Paramore's self-titled album in 2013. The band then consisted of Williams, Jeremey Davis, and Taylor York. Paramore remained quiet for some time until the sprung back to life in 2017 with the album After Laughter. A surprise turnabout occured with this one, as Jeremey Davis left the group and a previous member, Josh Farro, retook his place as the original drummer as of 2016. In total the group has released 5 albums and Williams a has been featured in three other songs, including "Bad Blood" by Taylor Swift.</p>
